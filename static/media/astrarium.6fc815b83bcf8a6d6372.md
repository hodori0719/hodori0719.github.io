Astrarium comes with an AR tool that magnifies celestial objects in the night sky above them, which factors in user-input telescope specifications and location data. Astrarium also has a headless astronomical database, and its public API contains hand-checked information on hundreds of celestial objects. Finally, it also comes with a full social network which allows users to track, share, and view observations, inspired by the likes of [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com) and [AniList](https://anilist.co).
