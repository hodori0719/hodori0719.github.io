The Davenport Pops Orchestra on Apr 26, 2024 at Battell Chapel, New Haven, CT

## About
### Remarks
This is one of my favorite arrangements: a series of TikTok memes, entirely devoid of what one might call musical "substance," held together entirely by a vaguely comprehensible "form" based on drama & irony.

The piece is structured around the contrast between orchestral pastiche and unapologetic "pops" scoring. For instance, it opens with a DJ-esque "mix" of Doja Cat's "Say So," which is orchestrally grounded only by a few carefully placed timpani cues. Calmer moments include a string adagio on "Runaway" and a beautiful clarion clarinet solo on "Coffee," both of which inevitably devolve into chaos.

Near the end, the concertmaster breaks out into a solo shortly repeated by the orchestra *tutti*, recalling classical concerto form. This is followed by a whole section ("Blueberry Faygo") for the sole purpose of holding the dominannt harmony to anticipate an outrageously bombastic coda.

### Program Notes
Perhaps our most intellectually sophisticated arrangement yet, *2021: A TikTok Medley* is a collection of the biggest hits from the video-sharing app TikTok.

Misleadingly titled, *2021* features some of TikTok’s most famous tunes from 2019 to 2023. Spanning dance hits, piano ballads, and viral memes, this arrangement implores the listener to expect the unexpected. Bookending it are Kevin Macleod’s upbeat “Monkeys Spinning Monkeys” and the intrepid sea shanty “The Wellerman.”

Many of these songs achieved their fame during the COVID-19 lockdowns of 2020. For many of us, they were an important way of coping with the pandemic, and these “throwbacks” continue to last as good memories of particularly difficult times.
