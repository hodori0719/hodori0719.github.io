The Davenport Pops Orchestra on Feb 25, 2023 at Woolsey Hall, New Haven, CT

## About
### Remarks
This is the first piece in my Joe Hisaishi "cycle," followed by [My Neighbor Totoro and His Dream of Flight](../music/work/totoro-wind-rises) and [Kiki's Delivery Service](../music/work/kikis-delivery-service). Like the other two, this piece is scored with extreme restraint (_properly_ might be another appropriate word) compared to many of my other arrangements. Moreover, it is somewhat faithful to the original piece, preserving the iconic piano introduction as well as the overall nasal quality of the melody.

The arrangement contains some motivic references to the soundtrack to _Death's Door_ (2021), which the orchestra had performed earlier that year.

### Program Notes
_Howl’s Moving Castle_ is a 2004 animated film by Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli, loosely based on the 1986 novel of the same name by Diana Wynne Jones. The film tells the story of Sophie, a young hatter leading a mundane, routine existence in a war-ridden kingdom, when she one day has a fateful encounter with the eponymous wizard, Howl. Howl is famed among the locals for his frightening power, but even more so, his beauty. That night, Sophie finds herself attacked by a witch whose curse turns her into an elderly woman. Shameful of her new appearance, Sophie hurriedly flees the town in search of Howl’s Moving Castle and a cure to her curse, a journey which implores her to question the meaning of age, war, vanity, friendship, and love.

Joe Hisaishi’s iconic main theme for the film, "Merry-Go-Round of Life," is originally scored for piano quintet, a sparse instrumentation which personifies the dreadful loneliness which troubles Sophie and each of her friends. Yet the film itself operates on an epic scale, and even Howl, with all his magic, is ultimately rendered powerless in the face of the technology of war that backgrounds their tale. In this arrangement, the orchestration expresses the inevitability of the latter, accompanying Howl’s grief with a heavy, bittersweet waltz. 

_Howl’s Moving Castle_ is among one of the most commercially successful Japanese films ever made, and industry-leading director Hayao Miyazaki’s personal favorite creation.
