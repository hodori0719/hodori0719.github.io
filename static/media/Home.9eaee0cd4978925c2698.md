Hi, I'm June! I'm currently pursuing a BS/MS in CS at Yale.

Previously, I interned as a software engineer at Spotify, where I worked on [Backstage](https://backstage.spotify.com) doing full-stack app dev. I'm also interested in systems (particularly graphics) and practical applications of probabilistic, randomized, \& approximation algorithms.

I'm a musician, [orchestrator](/music), and huge classical nerd. ðŸŽ¶ Other than that, I spend my time on all things creative: film, writing, & graphic design. Recently, I've also been hacking & rebuilding old Nintendo consoles.
