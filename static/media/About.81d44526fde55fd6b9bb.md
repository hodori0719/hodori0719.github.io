## About this site

This site is a simple markdown renderer in React/TypeScript, using the great `react-markdown` library. I designed and built the rest of the client, including my funny[^1] logo, from scratch overnight. I plan on posting the source code [here](https://github.com/hodori0719/hodori0719.github.io) once I'm done with it.
