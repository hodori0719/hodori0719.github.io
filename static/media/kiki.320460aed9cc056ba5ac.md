## About
### Remarks
This is the third piece in my Joe Hisaishi "cycle," following [The Merry-Go-Round of Life](../music/work/merry-go-round-of-life) and [My Neighbor Totoro and His Dream of Flight](../music/work/totoro-wind-rises). Like the other two, this piece is scored with extreme restraint (_properly_ might be another appropriate word) compared to many of my other arrangements. It also reuses ideas from my piano quartet version of [A Town With an Ocean View](../music/work/umi-no-mieru-machi), making this my third arrangement from the film.

Also like the other two, I directly employ several textures from Japanese concert band music in the middle section. For instance, the wind families take turns accompanying a lyrical solo on one of my favorite instruments, the euphonium, seamlessly blending to create the illusion of homogeneity.

### Program Notes
_Kiki’s Delivery Service_ is a 1989 Japanese animated film directed by Hayao Miyazaki and animated by Studio Ghibli. It tells the story of Kiki, a young witch who leaves her magical town in the countryside to start a life of her own in the city. Despite a promising start to her flying delivery business, she finds that she is unable to connect with the urban youth, who view her as old-fashioned and unrefined. As loneliness sets in, Kiki becomes depressed and falls into a magical slump.

Joe Hisaishi’s score for the film marks his fourth collaboration with Miyazaki in a partnership that continues to this day. The main theme, “A Town With an Ocean View,” is one of the most iconic works in his entire oeuvre. This arrangement combines this theme with two other selections from the soundtrack—“A Very Busy Kiki” and “Osono’s Request.”
