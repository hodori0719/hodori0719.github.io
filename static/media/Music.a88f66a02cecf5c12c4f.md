I am a self-taught[^1] composer, arranger, and orchestrator. My orchestral works have been performed regularly by the [Davenport Pops Orchestra](http://www.dpops.com/performances/?mode=arranger&id=72), which I've led for 3 years, as well the [Austin Civic Orchestra](https://austincivicorchestra.org/), UT Pops Orchestra, [John Baxter Symphony](https://johnbaxtermusic.com/), and other orchestras around the country.

If you'd like to discuss borrowing or purchasing[^2] one of my scores, please leave me a message on LinkedIn.

[^1]: though classical violinist by training; I'm very fond of my time with the Delaware County Youth Orchestra and the Philadelphia Youth Orchestra
[^2]: I happen to have many of my early (and often subpar) arrangements up on the score-sharing site [musescore.com](https://musescore.com/hodori), a few of which have reached quite a large audience. Several years ago, MuseScore made the unfortunate decision to paywall all of the work submitted by its own community. I won't discuss this incident here, but I largely echo [Bernard Greenberg's thoughts](https://bernardgreenberg.com/MuseScore.html) on this matter. Nevertheless, none of my scores can be downloaded for free anymore. I am committed to keeping them available to the internet; just contact me and I will send them to you. The exceptions are the large-scale orchestral compositions; that is, The Little Mermaid Suite and the Minecraft Suite, for which I still charge case-by-case.
[^3]: but it has been seen by the great Nelson Everhart himself!
