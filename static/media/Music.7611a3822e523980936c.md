I'm a composer, arranger, and orchestrator. My music focuses obsessively on timbre and color, embraces nonstandard and world instruments[^1], and—above all—makes resourceful use of amateur players to bring out the fullest possible sound. I've written over five hours of music for large orchestra over the last decade, but I've also worked with a cappella groups, four-piece bands, and all sorts of amorphous ensembles.

My music broadly takes influence from [hyper]pop, post-irony, and video games, while my orchestration blends 20th century modal music, contemporary new music, and the Japanese concert band tradition (吹奏楽/_suisōgaku_). You can hear this in [DPoponomenon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BisI6jAm1us), a medley structured in four parts that shows the breadth of what I can do with musical "fluff" and an amateur orchestra. There's also [Howl's Moving Castle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7MQFhZ1Y2s) for something slightly more traditional and idiomatic, or [Le Festin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeqeBGqpAts) for something more adventurous and colorful.

My orchestral works, most of which are arrangements, have been performed regularly by the [Davenport Pops Orchestra](http://www.dpops.com/performances/?mode=arranger&id=72), which I led for 3 years, as well the Austin Civic Orchestra, Atlas Orquesta, and collegiate/middle/high school orchestras around the world.

## Playing My Music

I'm available for commission, and my scores, listed below, are available for purchase[^2]. I typically provide scores free of charge for student-run organizations. Please contact me [here](/contact).

## Selected Works

*The instrumentation uses fairly standard [shorthand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorthand_for_orchestra_instrumentation); an asterisk denotes that one player is on the standard auxiliary counterpart, while 2d1 might denote that one of two players doubles on auxiliary. I can and have in the past rescored them to fit different ensembles.*

[^1]: In addition to working fluently with the standard orchestral auxiliaries, instruments I've included in an orchestra include saxophone quartet, electric guitar, euphonium, harpsichord, sitar, guzheng, mandolin, accordion, steelpan, synthesizer... that is to say, I'm happy to write for any kind of strange ensemble upon request.
[^2]: I happen to have many of my early (and often subpar) arrangements up on the score-sharing site [musescore.com](https://musescore.com/hodori), a few of which have reached quite a large audience. Several years ago, MuseScore made the unfortunate decision to paywall its own community's work. Largely resonating with [Bernard Greenberg's thoughts](https://bernardgreenberg.com/MuseScore.html) on this matter, I removed all my original compositions from the site. (According to the statistics I have access to, MuseScore has likely earned several hundred dollars from distributing my work.) Nonetheless I am committed to keeping my arrangements available to the internet; just contact me and I will send them to you free of charge.
