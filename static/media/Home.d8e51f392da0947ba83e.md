Hi, I'm June, a software engineer. In May, I graduated from Yale *summa cum laude* with a BS & MS in Computer Science.

Previously, I interned at Spotify, where I did full-stack web development with React/TS on [Backstage](https://backstage.spotify.com). I'm also interested in graphics pipelines, UI design, sustainability ventures, and any problem that scratches my brain.

Other than that, I write [orchestral music](/music) 🎶 semiprofessionally, draw for fun, hunt for extremely spicy food, and write about all of the above somewhere on the internet.
