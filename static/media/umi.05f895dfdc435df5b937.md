## About
In early 2022 during my second semester at Yale, I spent an hour every day arranging a song from a different anime series and shared them online. The ~40 second solo piano segment that opens this arrangement was one of the more popular shorts from that project, after which I decided to turn it into a string quartet. In 2025, I again reused some of these fragments in my [orchestral arrangement](/music/work/kikis-delivery-service) of the film's soundtrack.

## Instrumentation
2 violins, guitar, and piano
