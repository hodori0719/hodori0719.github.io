## About
### Remarks
This is more or less a medley of faithful transcriptions of the original score from the game, structured in three movements: I. The Wind and the Star Traveler, or the Main Theme, II. Jade Moon Upon a Sea of Clouds, which contains *Rapid as Wildfires* and *Liyue*, and III. Forest of Jnana and Vidya, or *Sumeru*. My original contribution is limited to some creative mapping from a pantheon of world instruments to three keyboards and two guitars, as well as other simplifications to make it more suitable for an amateur ensemble with a very sparse bass section.

To my knowledge, this arrangement has been performed by many school & community orchestras from around the world, including by the Austin Civic Orchestra at the Lampkin Pavilion on June 7 & 8, 2024.

### Program Notes
The fastest-selling video game of all time, *Genshin Impact* follows the journeys of a traveler who is one day separated from their twin sibling in the mysterious world of Teyvat. In search of their lost twin, the Traveler quests through Teyvat’s seven nations, becoming involved with each one’s affairs along the way and gradually uncovering the secrets of the world.

Composer Yu-Peng Chen’s award-winning score follows the Traveler throughout their adventure, using a variety of instruments and orchestral textures to represent the musical influences of each region. In this arrangement, we open with the main theme from the game before visiting two of the seven nations: Liyue, the land of contracts, and Sumeru, the land of wisdom. Liyue’s score blends elements of Chinese traditional music with more modern styles to convey the strength of its mountains and the prosperity of its people. Meanwhile, Sumeru’s, while primarily based on Hindustani classical music, draws from both Middle Eastern and Western classical traditions to paint the lush orchestral soundscape of a forest.
