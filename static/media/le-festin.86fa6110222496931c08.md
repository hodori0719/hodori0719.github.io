## About
### Remarks
This short piece was inspired by the [Genshin Suite](../music/work/genshin) I had written two years earlier. Just as the suite captures distinctly Chinese and South Asian aesthetics through its orchestration, I scored this arrangement in a similarly programmatic fashion, with the goal of completely removing my own voice and making it sound overtly "French" instead.

### Program Notes
Pixar’s *Ratatouille* (2007) tells the story of Remy, a Parisian rat who dreams of becoming a chef at a high-end restaurant. He fulfills this aspiration through the garbage boy Alfredo Linguini, who sneaks Remy into his restaurant in exchange for the rat’s help with cooking.

The film’s composer, Michael Giacchino, is among the most prolific in the industry. His oeuvre includes major works such as *The Incredibles* (2004), *Up* (2009), *Doctor Strange* (2016), *Coco* (2017), and, of course, *Ratatouille* (2007). 

Giacchino’s soundtrack is inspired by elements of jazz and café music in Paris. “Le Festin” (*“The Feast”*), the main theme from the film, is performed by French artist Camille, and is left in its source language in almost all versions of the movie. This arrangement features solos from the harpsichord, accordion, and guitar, emulating and expanding on some of the sounds of Paris which Giacchino sought to capture in his score.
