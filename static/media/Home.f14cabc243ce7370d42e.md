I'm June, and I like computers. I'm currently pursuing a BS/MS in CS at Yale.

Previously, I interned as a software engineer at Spotify, where I worked on their developer platform, [Backstage](https://backstage.spotify.com). I'm also interested in probabilistic algorithms, ML/DL, and graphics, owing to my background in math.

I'm a musician, [composer](/music), and huge classical nerd. ðŸŽ¶ Other than that, I spend my time on all things creative: film, writing, & graphic design.
