Hi, I'm June! I'm a software engineer currently finishing my BS & MS at Yale.

Previously, I interned at Spotify, where I did full-stack web development with React/TS on [Backstage](https://backstage.spotify.com). I'm also interested in design, graphics, sustainability ventures, or really any problem that scratches my brain.

Other than that, I write music for [orchestras](/music) 🎶, draw for fun, and write about all of the above in distant corners of the internet.
