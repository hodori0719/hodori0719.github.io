Hi, I'm June (Josh) Yoo, a software engineer.

In May, I graduated from Yale *summa cum laude* with a BS & MS in Computer Science. I'm interested in distributed systems, real-time audio & graphics pipelines, sustainability, and any problem that scratches my brain.

I occasionally write [orchestral music](/music) 🎶.
