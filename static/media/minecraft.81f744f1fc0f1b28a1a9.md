## About
This is the first piece I wrote for the Davenport Pops. Ironically, it's probably the best engraved, since it's the only one where I wasn't rushing to get to the first rehearsal. 

There's some challenging passage work throughout, particularly in the fifth movement. This has been performed several times by various school and community orchestras, including by the Austin Civic Orchestra in 2024.
