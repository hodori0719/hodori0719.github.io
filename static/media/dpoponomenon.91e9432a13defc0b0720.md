The Davenport Pops Orchestra on Oct 12, 2024 at Davenport College, New Haven, CT

## About
### Remarks
This is a medley of four popular songs from the summer of 2024. I was first introduced to them through during my internship that summer at Spotify. The title is a portmanteau of "DPops" (Davenport Pops) and "Femininomenon," a less popular song by Chappell Roan which is only heard during the opening four bars.

I decided to write this after seeing how well recieved my [TikTok medley](../music/work/tiktok) was, but cut back a lot on the sarcasm, instead settling on a more early-20th century style with a dash of drum kit. The third section, "BIRDS OF A FEATHER," borrows heavily from the finale to Joly Braga Santos's Fourth Symphony, written in 1950.

I'm quite proud of this piece, as I think it's particularly tighly argued. It's a bit of a shame how irrelevant these songs are now, but I anticipated as much when I was writing it. It's part of the charm, I guess. 

### Program Notes
The medley opens with a brief violin solo from Chappell Roan’s "Femininomenon." A quick modulation then appears to introduce a theme from Roan’s "Good Luck, Babe!," but it wanders off and modulates once again before leading into the song proper. Next, in order, come Sabrina Carpenter’s "Espresso"; Billie Eilish’s "BIRDS OF A FEATHER," which dies down to a murmur in the celli before building up to a tremendous tutti; and finally Chappell Roan’s "HOT TO GO!," which ends with a frenetic and bombastic coda.
