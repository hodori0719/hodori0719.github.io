I'm a software developer based in NYC and, temporarily, New Haven, CT. I'm currently pursuing a BS/MS degree at Yale.

I love building things. Some technologies I've been using a lot include React/React Native, TypeScript, Python, and Flask. More recently, I'm also doing DevOps with AWS, Docker, and Terraform. Occasionally, I dabble in ML/DL and graphics. I'd like to stay a lifelong learner, so I haven't counted myself out of other things just yet.

I'm also a classical musician. ðŸŽ¶ My [orchestrations](/music) (is that a Kubernetes reference?) of popular music have been performed by reputable ensembles across the US. Other than that, I spend my time on art & film criticism, graphic design, and gaming, some of which overlap with my passion for programming.
