The Davenport Pops Orchestra on Dec 9, 2023 at Battell Chapel, New Haven, CT

## About
### Remarks
This suite contains 20 minutes of music from the 2023 live-action *Little Mermaid*, as well as "Under the Sea" as a short encore. It is one of my most ambitious works in terms of length, difficulty, and orchestral forces, as it leans into the fluid, gesture-driven writing characteristic of Disney; for example, listen to "Poor Unfortunate Souls" or the finale.

### Program Notes
One of Disney’s most famous films of all time, *The Little Mermaid* is a timeless story of a mermaid princess who dreams of life on land. Equally remembered is its Oscar-winning soundtrack, composed and written by the legendary Menken/Ashman duo also responsible for *Beauty and the Beast* and *Aladdin*. Featuring “Part of Your World,” “Under the Sea,” “Poor Unfortunate Souls,” and “Kiss the Girl,” *The Little Mermaid* has produced a number of classics almost unparalleled by any other movie in the Disney canon. 

Its recent live-action remake, *The Little Mermaid* (2023), reimagines the tale as a two-part epic. Ariel’s journey to escape Triton’s kingdom and discover human love is paralleled by Prince Eric’s battle against royal tradition and his longing for adventure at sea. As the two unlikely lovers struggle to break free from the monotony of home and venture into each others’ unknowns, the infamous sea witch Ursula seizes the opportunity to take over Atlantica. Now joined by star songwriter Lin-Manuel Miranda, Menken’s new score for *The Little Mermaid* mirrors the new sense of duality between Eric and Ariel, land and sea, and home and adventure. 

This symphonic arrangement is divided into two movements: Ariel, which features “Triton’s Kingdom: Overture,” “Part of Your World,” and “Poor Unfortunate Souls”; and Eric, featuring “Wild Uncharted Waters,” “Kiss the Girl,” “Ursula Battle,” and “Finale”. Listen for Ariel, Eric, and Ursula’s motifs, represented by the core melodies of Part of Your World, Wild Uncharted Waters, and Poor Unfortunate Souls, weave together in this epic arrangement.
