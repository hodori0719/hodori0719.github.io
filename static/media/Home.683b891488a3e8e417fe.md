Hi, I'm June (Josh) Yoo, a software engineer.

In May, I graduated from Yale *summa cum laude* with a BS & MS in Computer Science. Before that, I interned at Spotify, where I worked on [Backstage](https://backstage.spotify.com). I'm interested in audio & graphics pipelines, UI/UX, sustainability ventures, and any problem that scratches my brain.

Other than that, I occasionally write [orchestral music](/music) 🎶, dabble in graphic design, and write about all of the above somewhere on the internet.
