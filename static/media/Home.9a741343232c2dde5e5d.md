I'm a software developer based in NYC and, temporarily, New Haven, CT. I'm currently pursuing a BS/MS degree at Yale.

I love building things. Recently, I've mostly been doing full-stack on web and mobile with React/React Native, TypeScript, Python, and Flask. I'm also quite interested in ML/DL, distributed computing, and graphics. You can see some of my projects [here](/projects).

I'm also a classical musician. ðŸŽ¶ My [orchestrations](/music) of popular music have been performed by large ensembles across the US. Other than that, I spend my time on art & film criticism, [writing](/writing), and gaming, some of which overlap with my passion for programming.
