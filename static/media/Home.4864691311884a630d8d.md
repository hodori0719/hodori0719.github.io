I'm a software developer based in NYC and, temporarily, New Haven, CT. I'm currently pursuing a BS/MS degree at Yale.

I love building things. Recently, I've mostly been doing full-stack on web and mobile with React, TypeScript, and Python. I'm also quite interested in ML/DL, graphics, and math. You can see some of my projects [here](/projects).

I'm a classical musician and [composer](/music). ðŸŽ¶ Other than that, I spend my time on art & film criticism, [writing](/writing), and gaming, some of which overlap with my passion for programming.
