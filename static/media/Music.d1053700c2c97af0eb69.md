I'm a composer, arranger, and orchestrator. My music focuses obsessively on timbre and color, embraces nonstandard and world instruments, and makes resourceful use of musicians at all skill levels. I've written over five hours of music for large orchestra over the last decade, but I've also worked with a cappella groups, four-piece bands, and all sorts of amorphous ensembles.

My music broadly takes influence from classical music, video game soundtracks, and post-irony, while my orchestration borrows techniques from the Japanese concert band tradition (吹奏楽/_suisōgaku_) with a contemporary bent.

My orchestral works, most of which are arrangements, have been performed regularly by the [Davenport Pops Orchestra](http://www.dpops.com), which I led for 3 years, as well the Austin Civic Orchestra, Atlas Orquesta, and various collegiate/high school orchestras around the world.

## Playing My Music

I typically provide scores free of charge for educational and student-run organizations. Please contact me [here](/contact). Otherwise, my scores, listed below, are available for purchase[^1], and I may or may not be available for commission.

## Selected Works

The instrumentation uses fairly standard shorthand—an asterisk denotes that one player is on the standard auxiliary counterpart, while 2d1 might denote that one of two players doubles on auxiliary. Exact instrumentation is listed on the page for the piece.

[^1]: Most of my arrangements were originally written for rather strange ensembles, so please contact me and I can reorchestrate for a more standard instrumentation.
[^2]: seen by the awesome Nelson Everhart himself!
[^3]: I happen to have many of my early (and often subpar) arrangements up on the score-sharing site [musescore.com](https://musescore.com/hodori), a few of which have reached quite a large audience. Several years ago, MuseScore made the unfortunate decision to paywall its own community's work. Largely resonating with [Bernard Greenberg's thoughts](https://bernardgreenberg.com/MuseScore.html) on this matter, I removed all my original compositions from the site. (According to the statistics I have access to, MuseScore has likely earned several hundred dollars from distributing my work.) Nonetheless I am committed to keeping my arrangements available to the internet; just contact me and I will send them to you free of charge.
