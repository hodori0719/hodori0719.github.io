This site is a simple markdown renderer in React, using the great `react-markdown` library. Each time you request a page, it grabs the corresponding markdown file and translates it into HTML[^1].

I designed and built the rest of the client, including my (hopefully) funny logo, from scratch overnight. I'm currently looking for more of my projects and writing to put here, and I plan on posting the source code [here](https://github.com/hodori0719/hodori0719.github.io) once I'm done with it.

[^1]: Obviously, I could pre-render each page to *slightly* improve performance, but I don't plan on publishing novels on this site, and I think the knowledge that the app is "building" each page live has a little bit of charm to it (on top of allowing me to share my true "source code" while decreasing storage overhead and being more generalizable).
