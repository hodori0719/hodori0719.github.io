I'm a software developer based in NYC and, temporarily, New Haven, CT. I'm currently pursuing a BS/MS degree at Yale while interning at Spotify.

I love building thingsâ€”recently, I've been doing full-stack on web and mobile with React, TypeScript, and Python. I also have interests in ML/DL, graphics, and probabilistic algorithms, owing to my background in math.

I'm a musician and [composer](/music). ðŸŽ¶ Other than that, I spend my time on film & film criticism, writing, graphic design, and Tetris.
