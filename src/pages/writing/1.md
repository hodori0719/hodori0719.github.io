Last week, a total solar eclipse passed through the continental United States, and what seemed like the entirety of New Haven gathered outside to see it. Unfortunately, since I had been one of the unlucky many to come up empty-handed in the exploding market for eclipse glasses, I was left staring at the ground while everyone else was looking up.

There's something incredibly uncanny about effecting phenomena as Very rarely will you see such drastic changes to natural constants as fundamental and invariant as the appearance of sunlight. Perhaps the most striking example of this is the shadows; it was not so hard to notice that shadows were noticeably sharper and more defined during peak coverage. But perhaps fewer saw the crescent moon dance under their trees. As the sun becomes thinner and thinner, the images of it projected through small holes in the foliage reflect its new shape. This is the science behind the pinhole camera, or the [*camera obscura*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_obscura) effect; and the same principle behind those goofy box projectors that my fellow non-glasses havers were using to look at the sun.

This can loosely be modeled as a convolution between the light source and the scene geometry, where the light from the sun is a filter and the scene is an image to be convolved. Hence in the case of a solar eclipse, with the sun reduced to a thin slice of its normal shape, the sun resembles something between a simple differential kernel and the Sobel kernel in one direction. So this explains the sharpening of the image, asiding the obvious explanation of the kernel.

Typical ray tracing implementations model sunlight directionally; that is, all rays of light from the sun point in the same direction at all loci. And ignoring more complex atmospheric effects, this makes sense; the Sun is over 93 million miles away from Earth (which is under 8000 miles in diameter), so any pair of lines from two points to the Sun could be approximated as parallel lines, with the Sun being the point at infinity at which they intersect. The problem is that the Sun itself is nearly a million miles in diameter, and so effectively the Sun is about as much of a point light to the earth as your phone's flashlight would be 6 inches from your face. 

Distributed ray tracing implements soft shadows by randomly sampling points in a disk around the true light source. This makes sense, as point lights do not exist in the real world; all lights have some area.

But obviously, this model does not allow for the rendering of, say, *this image*.

ChatGPT has been on the market for about 2 years now, and this day I still see optimistically hedonistic TikToks like: "imagine if we never had to work ever again!" Frankly, I don't believe that there will ever be a status quo in which people truly are satisfied with their lives

There's a sort of visual stillness to the rigidity of the shadows in Texhnolyze's surface world. Yes, the 

I'll leave you with [*Crescent Moon Dance* (三日月の舞)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHQJX8a8CWc), a triumphant piece for wind ensemble, and itself a stunning demonstration of light modeling in animation—now in two dimensions. The Japanese 舞 (*Mai*) literally means "dance", but it's most often used to describe flower petals or the fluttering of leaves in the wind. Hence the shimmer of leaf-convolved crescents during a solar eclipse is perhaps the ultimate realization of this imagery.
