The Davenport Pops Orchestra on Mar 1, 2025 at Woolsey Hall, New Haven, CT

## About
### Remarks
This arrangement contains a snippet (rewritten in 4) of "Fallen Down" from *Undertale*, the soundtrack of which the orchestra also played at the same concert.

A clip of this arrangement went viral on TikTok.

### Program Notes
Laufey is an Icelandic singer-songwriter whose music blends jazz, classical, and pop. Trained as a classical cellist and jazz vocalist from childhood, she rose to fame in the early 2020s through her performances on TikTok, going on to win a GRAMMY Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album for her sophomore record, Bewitched (2023), and becoming Spotify’s most-streamed jazz artist in 2022.

In this arrangement, we weave together two of our favorite songs from her discography (along with a tiny *Undertale* surprise), as voted on by the orchestra and arranged by three of our members. “Let You Break My Heart Again,” originally recorded by Laufey with the Philharmonia Orchestra, features sweeping string textures and introspective harmonies in a melancholic meditation on heartbreak. On the other hand, “Lovesick” combines a pulsing, anthemic energy with yearning harmonies, evoking feelings of intense longing and passion. Together, the two songs form a journey through the highs and lows of romance, as told by today’s biggest voice in jazz.
