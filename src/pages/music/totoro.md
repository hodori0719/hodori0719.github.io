## About
### Remarks
This arrangement combines the themes from my two favorite movies by Studio Ghibli (by a large margin, as well as two of my favorite films of all time). It is also the second piece in my Joe Hisaishi "cycle," preceded by [Howl's Moving Castle](../music/work/merry-go-round-of-life) and followed by [Kiki's Delivery Service](../music/work/kikis-delivery-service). Like the other two, this piece is scored with extreme restraint (_properly_ might be another appropriate word) compared to many of my other arrangements. 

### Program Notes
My Neighbor Totoro and His Dream of Flight is an original arrangement of the main themes from _My Neighbor Totoro_ (1988) and _The Wind Rises_ (2013), two films written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki and scored by Joe Hisaishi.

_My Neighbor Totoro_ has frequently been cited as one of the best animated films of all time, and its eponymous furry friend, Totoro, has become a part of the iconography of Studio Ghibli and modern Japanese culture at large. In the movie, two little girls and their father move to the countryside near a hospital where the girls’ mother lies bedridden. Around this time, the girls discover and befriend the local forest spirits, who help the girls cope with their boredom, loneliness, and fear. 

_The Wind Rises_ is the perfect counterpoint to the tale of Totoro, as Miyazaki revisits a familiar tale as a fully fledged filmmaker. Whereas _Totoro_ is a celebration of the power of imagination, _The Wind Rises_ is a story of dreams. The only one of Miyazaki’s films removed from the magical elements, _The Wind Rises_ tells the life story of an aeronautical engineer, Jiro Horikoshi, who devotes his life to creating the best aircraft Japan has ever seen. In pursuit of this dream, he gives up everything he has, even losing the love of his life to tuberculosis. But when the Imperial Navy takes over his industry and his art is twisted into weaponry, Jiro is forced to come to terms with the vanity of his craft and everything he has sacrificed for it.

Miyazaki’s upbringing was troubled by illness, and his mother was absent for much of his childhood as she battled tuberculosis in the hospital. These themes manifest themselves in Miyazaki’s writing, and there is a certain unease that underpins his films, however cheerful they may appear. Hisaishi’s scores, then, mirror this sentiment through his characteristic juxtaposition of uplifting melodies and melancholy harmonies. You will hear two of these compositions today. This arrangement opens with the main theme from _The Wind Rises_, then breaks out into the more lively theme from _My Neighbor Totoro_. Thereafter, the two themes take turns playing over each other, leading to a bombastic finale in which they ultimately weave together as one.
