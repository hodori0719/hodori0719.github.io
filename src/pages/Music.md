I'm a composer, arranger, and orchestrator. My music focuses obsessively on orchestration, as well as practicality, pastiche, and post-irony.

Over the last decade, most of my musical energy has been spent on large symphonic arrangements of popular music, of which I wrote around 5 hours in all. These have been performed regularly by the [Davenport Pops Orchestra](http://www.dpops.com), which I led for 3 years, as well the Austin Civic Orchestra, Atlas Orquesta, and various collegiate/high school orchestras around the world.

Recently, I've had less interest in (and time for) form, so I've been posting "snippets" on [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@8odori) instead.

## Playing My Music

I typically provide scores free of charge for educational and student-run organizations. Please contact me [here](/contact). Otherwise, my scores, listed below, are available for purchase[^1], and I may or may not be available for commission.

## Selected Works

The instrumentation uses fairly standard shorthand—an asterisk denotes that one player is on the standard auxiliary counterpart (for simplicity, euphonium is treated as auxiliary tuba), while 2d1 denotes that one of two players doubles on auxiliary. Exact instrumentation is listed on the page for the piece.
